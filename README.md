# ABSTRACT
The present study analyzes how much performance is gained when several configuration adjustments are made in the MySQL Database, a process called tuning. To perform this performance test, an international benchmark model called TPC-H will be used to measure workload, helping to support the decision. For that, two databases will be created: The first just following the model of creation and population of the tables indicated by TPC-H. In the second one, the possible configurations for queries to the bank will be made as well as possible. From the collected data, the values of the percentage gains in the consultations to this optimized database will be described.
